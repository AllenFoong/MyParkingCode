# 1. Introduction to MyParking System
In this project, our team designed and developed an interactive Smart Parking System using web technologies and hosted it online via InfinityFree. The goal of this project was to apply software engineering principles and agile methodologies (Scrum) in a practical context while solving a real-world problem — efficient and user-friendly parking reservation.

This system allows users to register, log in, and reserve specific parking slots based on available dates and times. It dynamically prevents overlapping bookings and enables users to view and cancel their reservations. The project emphasizes frontend usability and backend logic, combining HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.

The purpose of this system was to demonstrate real-world applications of core software engineering concepts, including iterative development, collaboration using version control, system architecture design, and interface implementation. Additionally, the system addresses key programming concerns such as data validation, real-time interaction, and database management.

# 2. System Logic
The Smart Parking System operates through a web-based interface where users can register, log in, and book available parking slots by selecting a preferred date and time. The system dynamically checks the database to ensure that only available time slots are shown, and it prevents double bookings by disabling already reserved times. Bookings are stored in a MySQL database and tied to each user’s account, allowing them to view or cancel their latest reservation. Admins can manage slots and monitor all bookings. The system integrates PHP for backend logic, JavaScript for interactivity, and MySQL for data storage, ensuring a smooth, real-time booking experience.
